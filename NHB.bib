  abstract = {Abstract             Clustered standard errors, with clusters defined by factors such as geography, are widespread in empirical research in economics and many other disciplines. Formally, clustered standard errors adjust for the correlations induced by sampling the outcome variable from a data-generating process with unobserved cluster-level components. However, the standard econometric framework for clustering leaves important questions unanswered: (i) Why do we adjust standard errors for clustering in some ways but not others, for example, by state but not by gender, and in observational studies but not in completely randomized experiments? (ii) Is the clustered variance estimator valid if we observe a large fraction of the clusters in the population? (iii) In what settings does the choice of whether and how to cluster make a difference? We address these and other questions using a novel framework for clustered inference on average treatment effects. In addition to the common sampling component, the new framework incorporates a design component that accounts for the variability induced on the estimator by the treatment assignment mechanism. We show that, when the number of clusters in the sample is a nonnegligible fraction of the number of clusters in the population, conventional clustered standard errors can be severely inflated, and propose new variance estimators that correct for this bias.},

Unfortunately, it is well documented that they are underrepresented in quality ECEC programs. In order to improve access to quality ECEC, it is important to understand the factors leading to these inequities. This paper is based on a synthesis of published literature on interventions aimed at improving access to ECEC. We propose a framework identifying the spectrum of factors influencing access to quality ECEC for disadvantaged populations. We also present, in the context of our proposed framework, different interventions that have been taken to improve access to ECEC opportunities for children from low socioeconomic and/or new immigrant backgrounds. We believe that the framework proposed in this paper serves not only as a framework by which to understand the overlapping processes, factors, and stages affecting access to ECEC, but also as a model to help decision makers coordinate their efforts and maximize their impact towards more equity in access to quality early childhood education.},

For basic experiments, we stress randomization-based inference as opposed to sampling-based inference. In randomization-based inference, uncertainty in estimates arises naturally from the random assignment of the treatments, rather than from hypothesized sampling from a large population. We show how this perspective relates to regression analyses for randomized experiments. We discuss the analyses of stratified, paired, and clustered randomized experiments, and we stress the general efficiency gains from stratification. We also discuss complications in randomized experiments such as noncompliance. In the presence of noncompliance, we contrast intention-to-treat analyses with instrumental variables analyses allowing for general treatment effect heterogeneity. We consider, in detail, estimation and inference for heterogenous treatment effects in settings with (possibly many) covariates. These methods allow researchers to explore heterogeneity by identifying subpopulations with different treatment effects while maintaining the ability to construct valid confidence intervals. We also discuss optimal assignment to treatment based on covariates in such settings. Finally, we discuss estimation and inference in experiments in settings with interactions between units, both in general network settings and in settings where the population is partitioned into groups with all interactions contained within these groups.},

Through 58 in-depth interviews, I demonstrate how differences in social and cultural capital between women of low and high socioeconomic status (SES) result in different ways of learning about health. Women of high SES have access to support groups, physicians, and the Internet, whereas women of low SES do not discuss their health problems with their peers, and lack access to and distrust physicians.

The reasons underlying this unequal access have been studied but not systematically. In addition, cognitive and behavioral factors (e.g., norms, decision heuristics, information, etc.) have been understudied and have not previously been theorized in this field of study as contributing to this unequal access. This article fills these gaps by making two major contributions to the literature. At the theoretical level, it proposes a comprehensive classification of the different factors that can underlie these dynamics. At the empirical level, it re-examines the existing evidence, evaluating the proposed factors' relevance through a PRISMA mixed-methods systematic review of the empirical literature. Relying on a cross-validated impact score and p-curve analyses, we find evidence that cognitive and behavioral factors could contribute as much as structural factors (e.g., shortage of places and fees) to this unequal access. However, current public policies often only target structural factors. If future research confirms our results, new public policies should be created considering these cognitive and behavioral factors. Otherwise, structural reforms' effectiveness could be severely limited.},

Based on a study of interviews with 32 couples, the article exa-mines the reasons for this persistent disqualification of childminders, emphasizing the social differentiation of this judgment according to gender as well as to the parents' social position and evolution. While upper-class parents tend to exclude the use of childminders in a manner resembling a presumption of class-related incompetence, middle and working-class parents express differentiated educatio-nal and socializing expectations inspired by a cultural interest in psychology, an academic reinterpretation of early learning, and an attachment to the cr{\`e}che as a preparation for kindergarten that instils discipline and autonomy in children. These expectations are compounded in the working-class couples interviewed by a fear of entrusting their children to women who cannot be controlled and who they suspect operate outside the restrictions imposed upon employees.},

The methods, the findings from their application, and their proper interpretation rest critically on who participates and when and where that participation is situated. Because there is a great deal of variation in the answers to these questions even within the United States, I focus on the U.S. experience. Over the past two decades, we have made considerable progress understanding the impacts of large-scale ECE participation in the U.S., as the literature has moved away from -- despite being still strongly influenced by -- small-scale model interventions. And yet, there is still much to be learned about the long-term effects of participating in ECE programs operating at scale, the mechanisms linking large-scale ECE interventions to later-life well-being, and the effects of ECE quality conditional on ECE participation.},

The article then presents illustrative examples, highlighting three common life factors---scarcity, health problems, and age-related cognitive decline. These factors create a human capital catch-22, increasing people's likelihood of needing state assistance while simultaneously undermining the cognitive resources required to negotiate the burdens they encounter while seeking such assistance.

Instead, we show that researchers should cluster their standard errors at the pair level. Using simulations, we show that those results extend to stratified experiments with few units per strata.}

Behavioral biases, intensified by complexity and uncertainty in the admissions and aid process, may explain this gap. In a large-scale experiment we test an early commitment of free tuition at a flagship university. The intervention did not increase aid: rather, students were guaranteed before application the same grant aid that they would qualify for in expectation if admitted. The offer substantially increased application (68 percent versus 26 percent) and enrollment rates (27 percent versus 12 percent). The results suggest that uncertainty, present bias, and loss aversion loom large in students' college decisions. (JEL I22, I23, I24, D31, I28)},

On the other hand, when there is one-sided non-compliance, they do identify effects for the treated because the populations of treated and compliers are identical in this case. However, this property is lost when covariates are included in the model. In this case, we show that the effects for the treated are still identified but require modified estimators. We consider both average and quantile treatment effects and allow the instrument to be discrete or continuous.}

To this end, we study first whether the access to formal early childhood education and care (ECEC) differs by parents' socio-economic status (SES), by means of logistic regressions. Second, we analyse the main effect of attending ECEC institutions. Third, we ask whether the effect of attending ECEC on children's competencies differs by SES. We perform OLS regression with inverse probability weighting to address confounding bias possibly arising from selection into care arrangements. Moreover, we developed a counterfactual analysis to compare the observed SES gradient in children's competencies with two alternative extreme scenarios, one characterized by the absence of ECEC, and the other by universalistic access to ECEC. Our findings show that ECEC attendance is socially stratified and suggest an equalizing impact of ECEC institutions. We conclude that ECEC can play a compensatory function on social stratification, by making the expansion of formal early childcare expenditures a fruitful investment for more equal opportunities.},

In the ELFE ({\'E}tude Longitudinale Fran{\c c}ais depuis l'Enfance) birth cohort study set in metropolitan France, children's development was reported by parents at age 3.5~years (n\,=\,11,033) via the Child Development Inventory (CDI) questionnaire. CDI scores were transformed into a development quotient (DQ), with a DQ\,{$<$}\,90 corresponding to possible and a DQ\,{$<$}\,85 corresponding to a probable developmental delay. Inverse probability weighted multivariable regression models were used to analyse whether early childcare in the first three years of life (centre-based, childminder, informal or parental care) was associated to development delay. Compared to children in exclusive parental care, those in centre-based childcare (CBC) or with a childminder prior to school entry were significantly less likely to experience possible (OR\,=\,0.56, [95\% CI\,=\,0.51--0.61] for CBC and OR\,=\,0.77, [95\% CI\,=\,0.72--0.83] for childminder attendance) and probable developmental delay (OR\,=\,0.62, [0.58--0.67] for CBC and OR\,=\,0.80 [0.76--0.83] for childminder). Informal childcare attendance was not significantly associated with children's possible nor probable developmental delay ((OR\,=\,0.97, [0.84--1.12]) and (OR\,=\,0.97, [0.82--1.15]), respectively). Conclusions: Overall, our findings add to the existing scientific literature, showing that in the French context, where childcare can start as early as 3~months of age, early childcare attendance can contribute to child's development.What's Known on This Subject:{$\bullet$} Studies on early childcare attendance and child development have shown mixed results, associations with better psychomotor development mainly being observed in Nordic countries, while some studies in other countries such as the USA showed no or negative associations.What This Study Adds:{$\bullet$} In a country with broad and subsidized access to childcare such as France, access to early childhood education can positively contribute to children's psychomotor development. However, we found that access to childcare does not appear to reduce social inequalities in children's psychomotor development.},

Individual discount rates are estimated for various households differentiated by socio-demographic characteristics such as income and age. Our conclusions are that discount rates are constant over the 6month to 3-year horizons used in these experiments, that discount rates vary with respect to several socio-demographic variables, and that they decline with age after middle age. Hence we conclude that it would be reasonable to assume constant discount rates for specific household types, but not the same rates across all households.},

  abstract = {Winner of the 2020 Outstanding Book Award Presented by the Public and Nonprofit Section of the National Academy of Management Winner of the 2019 Louis Brownlow Book Award from the National Academy of Public Administration  Bureaucracy, confusing paperwork, and complex regulations---or what public policy scholars Pamela Herd and Donald Moynihan call administrative burdens---often introduce delay and frustration into our experiences with government agencies. Administrative burdens diminish the effectiveness of public programs and can even block individuals from fundamental rights like voting. In AdministrativeBurden, Herd and Moynihan document that the administrative burdens citizens regularly encounter in their interactions with the state are not simply unintended byproducts of governance, but the result of deliberate policy choices. Because burdens affect people's perceptions of government and often perpetuate long-standing inequalities, understanding why administrative burdens exist and how they can be reduced is essential for maintaining a healthy public sector.  Through in-depth case studies of federal programs and controversial legislation, the authors show that administrative burdens are the nuts-and-bolts of policy design. Regarding controversial issues such as voter enfranchisement or abortion rights, lawmakers often use administrative burdens to limit access to rights or services they oppose. For instance, legislators have implemented administrative burdens such as complicated registration requirements and strict voter-identification laws to suppress turnout of African American voters. Similarly, the right to an abortion is legally protected, but many states require women seeking abortions to comply with burdens such as mandatory waiting periods, ultrasounds, and scripted counseling. As Herd and Moynihan demonstrate, administrative burdens often disproportionately affect the disadvantaged who lack the resources to deal with the financial and psychological costs of navigating these obstacles.  However, policymakers have sometimes reduced administrative burdens or shifted them away from citizens and onto the government. One example is Social Security, which early administrators of the program implemented in the 1930s with the goal of minimizing burdens for beneficiaries. As a result, the take-up rate is about 100 percent because the Social Security Administration keeps track of peoples' earnings for them, automatically calculates benefits and eligibility, and simply requires an easy online enrollment or visiting one of 1,200 field offices. Making more programs and public services operate this efficiently, the authors argue, requires adoption of a nonpartisan, evidence-based metric for determining when and how to institute administrative burdens, with a bias toward reducing them. By ensuring that the public's interaction with government is no more onerous than it need be, policymakers and administrators can reduce inequality, boost civic engagement, and build an efficient state that works for all citizens.},

Using a randomized lottery design, we estimate the effects of enrolling in a full-day UPK program in New Haven, Connecticut on parents' labor market outcomes as well as educational expenditures and children's academic performance. During children's pre-kindergarten years, UPK enrollment increases weekly childcare coverage by 11 hours. Enrollment has limited impacts on children's academic outcomes between kindergarten and 8th grade, likely due to a combination of rapid effect fadeout and substitution away from other programs of similar quality but with shorter days. In contrast, parents work more hours, and their earnings increase by 21.7\%. Parents' earnings gains persist for at least six years after the end of pre-kindergarten. Excluding impacts on children, each dollar of net government expenditure yields 5.51 in after-tax benefits for families, almost entirely from parents' earnings gains. This return is large compared to other labor market policies. Conversely, excluding earnings gains for parents, each dollar of net government expenditure yields only 0.46 to \$1.32 in benefits, lower than many other education and children's health interventions. We conclude that the economic returns to investing in UPK are high, largely because of full-day UPK's effectiveness as an active labor market policy.},

He exposes the extraordinary capabilities, and also the faults and biases, of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. He reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives, and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. This author's work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies. In this book, he takes us on a tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think and the way we make choices},

  abstract = {Because women typically serve as primary care providers for their children, female labor force participation behavior is likely to be affected signi cantly by the costs associated with replacing maternal care with nonmaternal care. While some evidence of this phenomenon exists in the economics literature, discrepancies across studies make it difficult to provide conclusive evidence of the employment effects of these child care costs. This paper uses an improved SIPP survey design to present new evidence regarding the degree to which child care prices impede mothers' employment behavior, with additional evidence of the difference in these elasticities across marital status, empirical technique, and equation speci cation. This permits linking this paper to the existing evidence, drawing the conclusion that child care prices impede mothers' employment behavior signi cantly, with single mothers exhibiting less responsiveness in their labor force participation behavior to child care price changes than married mothers. Generally, these results support the basic nding of Ribar (1992), reject the smaller price of care elasticities found by Averett et al. (1997), Blau and Robins (1988), Connelly (1992), and Tolin (1992), but replicate the lower elasticities found in these papers by changing equation speci cations. Also, signi cant sensitivity in the price elasticity is revealed, particularly with respect to changes in equation speci cation.},

Contrary to conventional wisdom, he argued that adjustment can lead to worsened asymptotic precision, invalid measures of precision, and small-sample bias. This paper shows that in sufficiently large samples, those problems are either minor or easily fixed. OLS adjustment cannot hurt asymptotic precision when a full set of treatment-- covariate interactions is included. Asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be constructed with the Huber-- White sandwich standard error estimator. Checks on the asymptotic approximations are illustrated with data from Angrist, Lang, and Oreopoulos's [Am. Econ. J.: Appl. Econ. 1:1 (2009) 136-- 163] evaluation of strategies to improve college students' achievement. The strongest reasons to support Freedman's preference for unadjusted estimates are transparency and the dangers of specification search.}

  abstract = {Burden of Poverty Lacking money or time can lead one to make poorer decisions, possibly because poverty imposes a cognitive load that saps attention and reduces effort. Mani et al. (p. 976; see the Perspective by Vohs) gathered evidence from shoppers in a New Jersey mall and from farmers in Tamil Nadu, India. They found that considering a projected financial decision, such as how to pay for a car repair, affects people's performance on unrelated spatial and reasoning tasks. Lower-income individuals performed poorly if the repairs were expensive but did fine if the cost was low, whereas higher-income individuals performed well in both conditions, as if the projected financial burden imposed no cognitive pressure. Similarly, the sugarcane farmers from Tamil Nadu performed these tasks better after harvest than before. The poor often behave in less capable ways, which can further perpetuate poverty. We hypothesize that poverty directly impedes cognitive function and present two studies that test this hypothesis. First, we experimentally induced thoughts about finances and found that this reduces cognitive performance among poor but not in well-off participants. Second, we examined the cognitive function of farmers over the planting cycle. We found that the same farmer shows diminished cognitive performance before harvest, when poor, as compared with after harvest, when rich. This cannot be explained by differences in time available, nutrition, or work effort. Nor can it be explained with stress: Although farmers do show more stress before harvest, that does not account for diminished cognitive performance. Instead, it appears that poverty itself reduces cognitive capacity. We suggest that this is because poverty-related concerns consume mental resources, leaving less for other tasks. These data provide a previously unexamined perspective and help explain a spectrum of behaviors among the poor. We discuss some implications for poverty policy. Being poor is a state of mind.

To do so, we use data on all childcare centres in the city of Vienna, Austria, on the spatial distribution of children aged under six and on three measures of neighbourhood status, over a period of eight years. We find that spatial accessibility is highest in neighbourhoods with the highest socioeconomic status, that such inequality has increased over time and that both effects can be attributed to the role of non-profits. The results indicate that the policy change undertaken in Vienna towards increased communitarisation -- that is, a shift towards non-profit provision -- has undermined the universal character of the city's childcare system.},

Here, we make the case that a cluster of behaviours is associated with lower socioeconomic status (SES), which we call ``the behavioural constellation of deprivation.'' We propose that the relatively limited control associated with lower SES curtails the extent to which people can expect to realise deferred rewards, leading to more present-oriented behaviour in a range of domains. We illustrate this idea using the specific factor of extrinsic mortality risk, an important factor in evolutionary theoretical models. We emphasise the idea that the present-oriented behaviours of the constellation are a contextually appropriate response to structural and ecological factors rather than a pathology or a failure of willpower. We highlight some principles from evolutionary theoretical models that can deepen our understanding of how socioeconomic inequalities can become amplified and embedded. These principles are that (1) small initial disparities can lead to larger eventual inequalities, (2) feedback loops can embed early-life circumstances, (3) constraints can breed further constraints, and (4) feedback loops can operate over generations. We discuss some of the mechanisms by which SES may influence behaviour. We then review how the contextually appropriate response perspective that we have outlined fits with other findings about control and temporal discounting. Finally, we discuss the implications of this interpretation for research and policy.},

Choice of a smaller-sooner sum was associated with several demographics: younger age, lower income, lower education; and impulsive behaviors: earlier age of first sexual activity and recent relationship infidelity, smoking, and higher body mass index.

Targeted early childhood interventions aimed at vulnerable children have lasting positive impacts throughout the participants' life course, consequently reducing inequalities. However, results from targeted programs cannot be generalized to universal Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC). Universal ECEC, available to all children, may increase inequalities given stratification in access to nationwide programs. In order to analyze whether universal ECEC has the same equalizing effects as the targeted programs, this study uses a systematic review and meta-analysis of quasi-experimental evidence to examine the impact of universal ECEC on children's outcomes throughout their lives, focusing on how it affects children from different socioeconomic statuses (SES). The findings indicate that universal ECEC is an effective policy strategy for equalization, as it reduces inequalities by benefiting more children from disadvantaged families. Low SES children benefit more in the non-cognitive domain than high SES children. Starting ECEC before age three improves the chances of better outcomes for disadvantaged children. The results demonstrate significant variability across regions, with European programs standing out in delivering positive outcomes for children from vulnerable backgrounds. The study emphasizes the importance of equitable access to universal ECEC to reduce inequalities and foster long-lasting positive impacts on children's develop\- ment and life chances.},

Exploiting a universal childcare reform in Quebec in 1997 and the variation in its timing relative to childbirth across cohorts of parents, we show that earlier access to childcare increases employment among new mothers, particularly among those previously unemployed. Earlier childcare access increases new mothers' reallocation of careers into more demanding jobs in male-dominated firms, leading to higher earnings and higher productivity. Firms traditionally unattractive to women with children benefit from such reallocation, experiencing higher growth and performance. Our results suggest that childcare frictions hamper women's career progression and their allocation of human capital in the labor market.},

  abstract = {We analyse both academic literature and practice reports to discover the main causes for unequal accessibility of high quality early childhood care and education (ECEC). In order to understand and to remedy this inequality we need to consider the interplay between elements of governance, of the management of services and elements on the level of parents. From this analysis as well as from reports on successful inclusive practises, we arrive at five quality criteria and make 13 recommendations for policy and practice.},

  abstract = {Childcare services are increasingly regarded a major policy lever to combat social inequalities in early life. Yet, it was shown that inequality in the use of childcare services is the norm rather than the exception in European and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. As a result, social inequalities between disadvantaged and advantaged children are likely to be reinforced instead of being narrowed. The aim of this article is to conduct a macro-level analysis exploring which welfare state characteristics are associated with inequality in childcare use. We find that government involvement in the availability, affordability and quality of service provision is related to lower levels of inequality in childcare use. The results also suggest an impact of labour market opportunities and parental leave schemes. The findings contribute to a proper understanding of the institutional mechanisms underlying inequality in childcare service use.},

  abstract = {In this contribution, we examine whether and why there is a gap in the use of formal childcare services between immigrant and native families across 21 European countries. We focus on three sets of potential determinants: (1) social class, education and labour market position; (2) immigrant-specific factors such as norms in the region of origin, citizenship acquisition and length of stay in the country of residence; and (3) contextual factors such structural constraints impeding access to childcare and traditional norms on motherhood in the region of origin. Drawing on data from the 2010 ad hoc module of the EU Labour Force Survey, we find evidence for an immigrant-native gap in formal childcare use. Adjusted for social class position, education and maternal employment, immigrant families are less likely to use childcare compared to native families across European countries. However, there are important cross-country differences in the size of this gap. The study also provides evidence for immigrant-specific explanations: acquiring citizenship and staying longer in the country of residence increases the probability to use childcare, while the strength of traditional norms in the region of origin reduces the probability to use childcare. Finally, we find that structural barriers to childcare use negatively affect childcare use for both native and immigrant families. Removing barriers to childcare use in terms of availability and affordability will benefit everyone.},

This topic has long been of interest to economists, developmental psychologists, and scholars from other disciplines, and has been the focus of increased attention in recent years, as research has provided additional evidence about the processes of development in the earliest days, weeks, and years of life.1 In this paper, I review the evidence on two broad sets of questions: what we know about the potential benefits of early intervention child care programs, and what we know about the e¤ects (whether positive or negative) of maternal employment and child care in the first years of life. The evidence reviewed in this paper suggests that we now know a good deal about both sets of questions. But, this review also suggests that there are important gaps in our knowledge that future work by economists could fruitfully address.},

  abstract = {This study measured the discount rates of a sample of 262 farm households in the Ethiopian highlands, using a time preference experiment with real payoffs. In general, the median discount rate was very high---more than double the interest rate on the outstanding debt---and varied systematically with wealth and risk aversion. Although we do not have a good theory for explaining the linkage between rates-of-time preferences (RTPs) and risk aversion, our findings warn that these two aspects of household behavior reinforce each other and are easily confused. Our results have important implications for understanding households' behavior. Because the RTPs were so high, what might seem like profitable investments from the outside might not seem so from the farmers' perspectives. Furthermore, when future returns were uncertain, risk-averse decision makers favored projects with shorter payback periods and were less willing to invest in projects with long-term benefits. Formal capital market development, including lending and mortgage markets---currently non-existent in most of rural Ethiopia---may help reduce RTPs and cause more investments to be acceptable. The results also suggested the need for more research on the linkages between risk aversion and RTPs in low-income countries.},
