## Abstract
  Access to high-quality early childcare for low socioeconomic status (SES) households has the potential to mitigate socioeconomic inequalities. Yet, there is an SES-based gap in early childcare enrolment. While low-SES households would benefit the most from attending early childcare, they access early childcare the least. This study tackles cognitive and behavioural barriers behind this access gap. We test the effectiveness of informational interventions and personalised support to enhance early childcare application and access for low-SES households through a multi-arm experiment. Results reveal that the information-only treatment had minimal impact while adding personalised support significantly bridged the SES-gap in early childcare applications. However, despite large impacts on application rates, we found limited impacts on access rates for low-SES households. By identifying key obstacles to early childcare access for low-SES households, our research underscores the need for effective strategies to promote equal opportunities in early childhood education.

## How to download and replicate {#replicate}

To reproduce the findings and re-run the analysis, do the following:

1. Download and install this repository. 
2. Open `RCT_RR_NHB.Rproj` to open an [RStudio Project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html).
3. Within the RStudio Project, open the `ManuscriptNHB.Rmd` file and run it to replicate the main paper
4. Within the RStudio Project, open the `SupplementaryInformation.Rmd` file and run it to replicate the Supplementary Information file.

The source code can be found in the `.Rmd` and `.R` files. 

Please find the [session info below](#session-info).

*Estimated installation time* : If you have R and Rstudio installed, then adding additional packages required in our R scripts is quick (a couple of minutes)

*Estimated run time*: Rendering the `ManuscriptNHB.Rmd` document takes about 5mins on our machine, both on Mac and PC (see [session info](#session-info))
