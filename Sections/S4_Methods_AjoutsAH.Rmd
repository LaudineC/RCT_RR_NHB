## Analysis plan 

### Randomisation protocol

To improve precision and ensure balance on a set of characteristics likely to affect our main outcomes, we used a block-random assignment procedure based on the cross product of: i) Education of the mother (“tertiary”/“secondary or lower”), ii) Intention to use early childcare (“no”/“yes but has never used early childcare before”/“yes and already has used early childcare before”), and iii) Supply (early childcare coverage rate higher/lower than the average in the department).  

We collected data over a three-month period and defined “waves” of two-weeks periods over which we performed the assignment procedure. Ultimately, our design was built on 6 randomisation waves with three assignment conditions in the 12 blocks of each lottery so there are 72 design variables.
let $b_w \in B_w \subset B$ index blocks in all waves $w$ and $\symbfup{B}$ the matrix of block $\times$ waves.

Let $s \in S$ index subsets of the data that partition the sample into comparison paris and, optionally, additional covariates.  Each $s$ corresponds to a grouping rule that defines a subset of observations which allow flexible and tidy notations of treatment effects.

### Assignment probabilities

Each individual from the baseline sample had a 1/3 probability of being assigned to one of three groups: control, information-only, or information + support. Since our analyses compared pairs of assignment conditions (e.g. information-only vs. control), our analyses relied on conditional assignment probabilities that exclude one treatment arm. However, some blocks had a small or odd number of observations, potentially resulting in slight variations in assignment probabilities across groups. To account for this, we estimated a probit model of assignment based on block-fixed effects in subsamples of pairwise comparisons. We then used the predicted probabilities from these models as propensity scores, denoted as $p_{ibs}$ , where subscripts $ibs$ denote the household $i$ of block $b$ in sub-sample of pairwise comparison $s$. With these, we define inverse propensity score weights $w_{ibs}=\frac{Z_{ibs}}{p_{ibs}}+\frac{(1-Z_{ibs})}{(1-p_{ibs})}$ and centred assignment $\tilde{Z}_{ibs}=Z_{ibs}-p_{ibs}$ where $Z_{ibs}$ is a dummy that equals 1 when the household $i$ of block $b$ has been assigned to the treatment group in sub-sample $s$.

<!-- ## Intention to action gaps -->

<!-- We analyse the intention-to-action gap between different social groups (High/low SES, migration background) ($\mathbf{X}$) and subjective attributes (Information, temporal orientation) ($\mathbf{K}$). -->

<!-- Formally, the gap between two sets of values of covariates $\mathbf{x}$ $\mathbf{x^\prime}$ in intention to use at baseline is: -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \Delta_{x,x'}(W_i) = E\left(W_i|\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}\right)-E\left(W_i|\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x^\prime}\right) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- The application gap is : -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \Delta_{x,x'}(\tilde{Y}_i) = E\left(\tilde{Y}_i|\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x})-E\left(\tilde{Y}_i|\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x^\prime}) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- Denoting $\tilde{Y^*}$ the variable for access to formal childcare, The access gap is : -->

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \Delta_{x,x'}(\tilde{Y*}_i) = E\left(\tilde{Y^*}_i|\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x})-E\left(\tilde{Y^*}_i|\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x^\prime}}) -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

<!-- In our setting, the covariates are discrete and we estimate them with data from the control group using OLS on group dummies and heterokedasticity robust standard errors. -->

## Intention to treat : main average effects

Our main estimands are the average intention-to-treat effects of each 

Because we have two treatment arms, we followed Goldsmith-Pickham (2024) and used stacked regressions to estimate the average difference between each pair of assignment condition $S_i \in \{\text{'Information only-Control’}, \text{'Information + support-Control’}, \text{‘Information + support-Information only'}\}$, while avoiding contamination bias in our estimates. We used the following equation: 

$$
Y_{ibs}=\sum_s\sum_b \gamma_{bs} B_{ib}+\sum_s\beta_sZ_{ibs}+\varepsilon_{ibs}
$$

Where Y denotes the outcome of individual $i$ of block $b$ in sub-sample $s$ ; $B_{ibs}$ denotes block-wave dummies and are interacted with $S_{is}$, a factor variable of sub-sample pairs of treatment arms. $Z_{ibs}$ is a dummy that equals 1 when the household $i$ of block $b$ has been assigned to the treatment group in sub-sample $s$. The estimates of $\beta_s$ correspond to the average intention to treat effect [@AtheyImbens2017]. Following Chaisemartin-Ramirez (2022) and  Abadie Et. Al. (2022), we used cluster-heterosckedasticity-robust standard errors adjusted at the block level [@deChaisemartinRamirez-Cuellar2020;@AbadieEtAl2022].This adjustment is very conservative as shown by Abadie Et. Al. (2022), and the detected effects correspond to the lower bound one could expect given these treatments [@AbadieEtAl2022].

### Robustness checks

As pre-registered, we assessed the robustness of our results using a data-driven selection of potential confounders with post-lasso and estimated both pooled and fully-interacted regressions following Negi Wooldrige (2021) and Lin (2013), allowing heterogeneous treatment effects within blocks[@NegiWooldridge2021;@Lin2013]. The pooled regression use OLS to estimate the following equation:

$$
Y_{ibs}=\sum_b \gamma_{bs} B_{ibs}+\beta_sZ_{ibs}+\mathbf{\dot{X}^\prime}\rho_s+\upsilon_{ibs}
$$
And Lin regressions:
$$
Y_{ib}=Z_{ibs}+\mathbf{\dot{X}^\prime}\rho_s+ \mathbf{\dot{X}^\prime}Z_{ibs}\tau_s+\upsilon_{ibs}
$$


With $\mathbf{\dot{X}}$, the matrix of covariates selected by the lasso method and previously centred.

Lasso selection and estimations were performed separately for each comparison pair and inference was based on point-wise standard errors clustered at the block-level.

We also reproduced our main analyses using a linear probability model with one dummy for each treatment arm and strata fixed effects, and logistic regressions.

## Local average treatment effect of administrative support

In our setting, administrative support was only offered to those assigned to the information + support treatment group, making non-compliance one-sided. Out of the households that were offered the support, 52% opted for it on average (See Extended Data Table 2). Thus, under exclusion restriction, an instrumental variable strategy using assignment to the information + support treatment group to predict compliance with support can retrieve the Local average treatment effect (LATE), which can have, an “average treatment effect on the treated” interpretation [@FrolichMelly2013;@ImbensAngrist1994].In this setting, there were two pairs of comparison: Information + support $vs$ control or Information + support $vs$ information only. The former identifies the treatment effects of 
Denoting $D_{ibs}=1(\text{received support})$ the compliance status, we estimated the average treatment effect on the treated through the following system of equations using weighted TSLS:

$$
TSLS~\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
Y_{ibs}=&\sum_b \alpha_{bs}B_{ibs}+\delta_s D_{is}+\mu_{is}\\
D_{ibs}=& \sum_b \gamma_{bs}B_{ibs}+\pi_s\tilde{Z}_{is}+\epsilon_{is}\\
\end{array} \right. 
$$

The instrument $\tilde{Z}$ was the dummy for being in the information + support group demeaned within block using the estimated instrument propensity score. We interpreted the coefficient $\pi_s$ as the average first stage effect. 
As Borusyak Et Al (2024) showed, this model retrieved a weighted average of block-specific treatment effects[@BorusyakEtAl2024]. We used cluster robust standard errors adjusted at the block level.


the same set of hypotheses, the average missing potential outcome for the treated is identified and, in fact, so is any measurable function $g(\cdot)$ of that potential outcome, as long as $g(\cdot)$ has finite first moment  [@FrolichMelly2013a]. Formally:

$$
E\left(g\big(Y^k(0)\big)|D=1\right)=\frac{\int E(g\big(Y(0)\big)|\mathbf{B}=b,Z=0)dF_B(b)-E(g\big(Y^k(0)\big)\times(1-D))}{Pr(D=1)}
$$
Thus, To compute the probability that untreated compliers - parents who would have accepted administrative support had it been offered to them -  applied to any childcare, we define $g(\cdot)=(1-D_i)\one{Y_i\leq \varepsilon}$ with $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$ and run a TSLS on $(1-D_i)$ instrumented by $Z_i$, with block fixed effects.

## Conditional average treatment effects

Our strategy was to use subgroup analysis to see whether different populations respond to the treatment differently in accordance with our theories. However, these differences in conditional average treatment effects could only be interpreted as a descriptive measure of association between the group and the treatment effect, but would not represent the causal effect of a change in the group value on the ATE since the group is not randomly manipulated.
We estimated average treatment effects by pre-specified subgroups following the same estimation strategy as the main models presented above. We retrieved conditional average effects using fully saturated stacked regressions interacting all right hand side variables with subgroup dummies (see Goldsmith-Pinkham et Al. (2022))[@Goldsmith2022]. In the two stage least squares models, we estimated one first stage for each sub-group. 

# Inference and tests

We adjusted p-values and confidence intervals to account for the Family-wise error rates using the Young-Westfall method using the R package multcomp [@BretzEtAl2010].
Our multiple testing procedure adjusted, for each outcome, the p-values and confidence intervals for simultaneous inference on the 3 comparisons (information - control, information + support - control, information + support - information only).

All analyses were performed using R 4.3.0 and R studio 2023.12.1.
