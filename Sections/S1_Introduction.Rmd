Access to high-quality early childcare  for low-socioeconomic status (SES) and immigrant households can potentially reduce social inequalities [@GhirardiEtAl2022;@Schmutz2024].Early childcare facilitates women’s employment, which leads to increased family income and reduced gender inequalities [@dAlbisEtAl2017;@HermesEtAl2022;@Kimmel1998;@MartinezPerticara2022;@HumphriesEtAl2024]. It can also mitigate the gaps in children’s development by SES and migration background when the quality of care is high3–5,10–12[@GhirardiEtAl2022;@Schmutz2024;@BergerEtAl2021;@Waldfogel2002].  However, access to early childcare remains significantly lower among low-SES and immigrant households in most OECD countries, limiting its potential to mitigate inequalities [@Waldfogel2002; @OECD2019b]. Therefore, facilitating access to early childcare for those who would benefit the most and closing these access gaps is paramount from a policy perspective.

Addressing the access gap requires a comprehensive understanding of its underlying determinants. This article investigates the causal role of cognitive and behavioural barriers to early childcare application in the French context. France is a compelling case study because accessibility (e.g. availability of early childcare slots) and affordability (i.e. direct and indirect financial costs) barriers that are known to impede access to early childcare enrolment are comparatively small [@PavoliniVanLancker2018]. France offers more access to high-quality early childcare than many OECD countries. It also mitigates affordability issues through substantial financial aid (reducing costs up to 70 EUR (73.5 USD) monthly for low-income households, including diapers and meals) [@BergerEtAl2021;@GomajeeEtAl2018]. Despite these favourable conditions, access remains highly unequal, with a 65-percentage points gap in attendance between the third and first income tertiles in 2014 [@OECD2025]. Similarly, the enrolment rate in early childcare for recently arrived non-EU migrant children aged 0–2 was only 18%, compared to 38% for the general population in 2018 [@EremenkoUnterreiner2023a]. A €3.4 billion government investment in 2017 to increase capacity had a limited impact on this gap [@Pora2020], suggesting that other factors prevent low-SES and immigrant families from applying for early childcare[@Cnaf2018].

Following Janssens and Van Mechelen (2022), this study relies on a multilevel theoretical framework to conceptualise the sources of these disparities. This framework recognises that household-level constraints emerge from the broader administrative, policy, social and legal context in which families operate[@JanssensVanMechelen2022;@vanOorschot1991]. At the household level, it identifies three distinct categories of costs faced when applying for early childcare: information, process, and psychological/social costs. These costs can disproportionately burden certain demographic groups, creating cognitive and behavioural barriers that lead to non-take-up of available services.

Information costs refer to the efforts people expect and spend to gather information about early childcare availability, eligibility criteria, fees, and application procedures [@JanssensVanMechelen2022;@CarbucciaEtAl2022a;@FenechSkattebol2019;@Holloway1998]. These costs are particularly salient for low-SES and immigrant households due to lower administrative literacy, language barriers, and weaker social  networks [@Bell2014;@RadeyRandolph2009;@RothbaumEtAl2008]. Indeed, friends and families can reduce information costs, for instance, by providing key information to succeed in the application process.

Process costs arise from the administrative burden of the application process itself and refer to the expected and experienced resources expended to apply, including form completion, travel requirements, and waiting times[@ChristensenEtAl2020;@HerdEtAl2023;@Sunstein2019;@VandenbroeckLazzari2014;@Sunstein2019]. Social networks can mitigate these administrative burdens and reduce such costs, for instance, by helping with form completion.

Psychological and social costs also contribute to non-take-up dynamics[@HermesEtAl2021;@MoynihanEtAl2015;@CarbucciaEtAl2023]. In the context of early childcare access, psychological costs may operate through four main mechanisms. First, choice overload and complexity can heighten the cognitive burden of selecting childcare options, potentially leading to decision paralysis or procrastination[@MisuracaEtAl2024;@ScheibehenneEtAl2010]. Second, present bias is typically more substantial among low-SES populations and can contribute to further delaying the application processs[@HarrisonEtAl2002;@LudwigEtAl2019c;@PepperNettle2017;@YesufBluffstone2008]. Third, poverty-induced cognitive scarcity may reduce low-SES parents’ cognitive bandwidth available for early childcare decision-making, leading them to rely on heuristics such as defaulting to parental care, an option more common in low-SES and immigrant families’ social networks46–48. In this regard, families’ social networks may impose social costs if negative attitudes towards early childcare prevail within these networks. Social costs, therefore, refer to the perceived and experienced reputational costs of adopting a behaviour that deviates from perceived descriptive and prescriptive norms. While sociological research highlights these influences16,27, recent findings increasingly question their magnitude in early childcare decisions16,19,49. 

The literature has extensively studied accessibility and affordability barriers as drivers of early childcare access gaps. However, cognitive and behavioural barriers, along with the information, process, psychological and social costs that generate them, have received considerably less attention[@CarbucciaEtAl2023], despite recent research that underscores their role in various non-take-up dynamics[@BettingerEtAl2012;@HerbautGeven2020]. We designed and tested two scalable interventions targeting the sources of the cognitive and behavioural barriers identified in our theoretical framework to mitigate disparities in early childcare access. 

The first intervention (‘information-only treatment’ henceforth) targets information and psychological costs through simplified, timely information delivery. We delivered information via five text messages, each containing a link to a short video. The videos presented the different types of early childcare services, provided detailed estimates of childcare costs, and provided information on childcare centres near households’ homes and detailed application procedures. We also provided additional tips, such as the importance of applying early and to multiple early childcare services to improve admission chances. Additionally, participants received three personalised reminders at three-month intervals. All messages and videos were plain and translated into English and Arabic. The cost of this treatment was minimal, at 5.5 EUR (6 USD) per participant. The mothers received the videos between the fourth and ninth months of pregnancy.

While structural factors have been extensively studied as determinants of unequal access  cognitive and behavioural factors have received much less attention despite recent research in psychology and behavioural economics highlighting their role in various non-take-up dynamics, such as access to higher education, healthcare, and welfare programs[@CarbucciaEtAl2022a;@HermesEtAl2021].

The second intervention (‘information + support treatment’ henceforth) further addressed process costs by offering direct support to overcome administrative burden. It included the same information as the first treatment, together with personalised application support through phone calls, a combination effective in reducing non-take-up[@BettingerEtAl2012;@HerbautGeven2020] Trained interviewers conducted the calls two to five months after households had received the videos. This intervention was tailored to address the different stages of the decision-making process. For parents who were undecided about applying for a childcare spot, we mentioned criteria such as accessibility and affordability through cost simulations. Once parents had made their choice, we offered tailored assistance, ranging from helping them select an appropriate early childcare facility to providing support in completing application forms. The cost of this treatment was 55 EUR (60 USD) per participant, with  with `r MainDB %>% filter(Assignment == "T2") %>% pull(TotalMinutes_AdminSupport) %>% mean(na.rm = TRUE) %>% round(0) ` minutes (median:`r MainDB %>% filter(Assignment == "T2") %>% pull(TotalMinutes_AdminSupport) %>% median(na.rm = TRUE) %>% round(0)`) spent per household on average.

We evaluated the effectiveness of these two interventions through a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in the French context. In this country, early childcare options include childminders and a variety of daycare centres managed by local administrations, associations, and private firms (more details in the Methods part). Because demand outrides supply, most daycare managers allocate available slots based on priority rules. Historically, dual-earner households have been prioritised. However, this criterion is no longer intended for application, and households experiencing social vulnerabilities are expected to receive increased prioritisation. In practice, because facilities have the discretion to determine which priority rules they wish to implement, substantial variation exists, and these rules are not always transparent to families. In contrast, childminders retain the autonomy to select the households they serve.

We targeted pregnant women between their fourth and ninth month of pregnancy whom we approached during their check-up visits in 8 maternity wards in the Paris region. The final sample consisted of `r round(MainDB %>% nrow(), digit = 2)` households, of which `r round(MainDB %>% filter(Educ == "Bac") %>% nrow(), digit = 2)` were from a low-SES background, as primarily defined by households in which the mother did not attend any post-secondary education, and 845 immigrant households, i.e. households in which the mother was not born in France (see Methods section). Both interventions targeted all participants, regardless of their socioeconomic status, but were specifically designed to reduce the costs low-SES and immigrant households face when applying for early childcare, identified through prior qualitative fieldwork. To increase the external validity of our findings, we implemented the trial across 84 municipalities located in three provinces of the Paris metropolitan area (Paris, Val-de-Marne, and Seine-Saint-Denis), each with different application processes and availability of early childcare slots but similar early childcare costs (see Methods and Supplementary Information 1). 

We collected baseline data through face-to-face interviews conducted immediately after recruitment in the maternity wards and endline data through computer-assisted telephone interviews one year later (see Figure 1 for a detailed study timeline). We chose the timing of the endline to coincide with the closure of most early childcare admissions for the birth cohort included in the study. Each survey included comprehensive data on households’ demographic characteristics, early childcare preferences, intentions to use early childcare, knowledge about early childcare, past experience with early childcare facilities, and mothers’ temporal orientation. In addition, the endline survey included the pre-registered primary outcome variable on application, i.e. whether households had applied to early childcare, and the secondary outcome variable on access, i.e. whether households had accessed early childcare.
We pre-registered the following main hypotheses: Both the information-only treatment and the information + support treatment increase early childcare applications ($H_{1a}$ and $H_{1b}$, respectively) and access ($H_{1c}$ and $H_{1d}$) compared to the active control condition in which households received unrelated information about maternal and child health. Additionally, because it reduces process costs, we predicted that the information + support treatment would substantially affect applications ($H_{2a}$) and access ($H_{2b}$) more than the information-only treatment. Finally, given that the treatments emphasise daycares, we also predicted, as part of exploratory analyses, that the effect of both treatments would be stronger for daycare applications ($H_{3a}$ and $H_{3b}$, respectively) and access ($H_{3c}$ and $H_{3d}$, respectively). The treatment placed special emphasis on daycares because parents prefer them; they are less expensive for low-income households compared to other types of childcare, such as private childminders or nannies, and they are more prevalent in the catchment area of the intervention[@CartierEtAl2017].

Given the goals of this study, we were particularly interested in treatment heterogeneity. To reduce the number of tested hypotheses, we concentrated our predictions on the information + support treatment as this treatment was deemed most likely to minimise the gaps effectively. We predicted that the information + support treatment would have a more considerable impact on application and access for low-SES households ($H_{4a}$ and $H_{4b}$, respectively) than for high-SES households. Similarly, we predicted that the information + support treatment would have a larger impact on application and access of immigrant households ($H_{5a}$ and $H_{5b}$, respectively).  

We also pre-registered several additional hypotheses about potential mechanisms. First, because our treatment aimed to decrease not only process costs but also information costs, we predicted that the treatment would have a greater impact on application and access of households with limited baseline knowledge about early childcare (H6a and H6b, respectively) and households who had never used early childcare before (H7a and H7b, respectively). Because it also aimed to decrease psychological costs, we also predicted this treatment to have a greater impact on inactive mothers, who may feel less legitimate to apply without support (H8a and H8b, respectively; see Methods section). Similarly, because it decreases the immediate costs of application, we predicted, as part of exploratory analyses, that the treatment would have more impact on present-biased participants (H9a and H9b, respectively).  By examining these hypothesised mechanisms, our study not only tests the efficacy of targeted interventions but also sheds light on the underlying pathways through which inequalities in early childcare access are reproduced, thereby providing crucial insights for evidence-based policy.
