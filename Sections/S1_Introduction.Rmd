Access to high-quality early childcare for low-socioeconomic status (SES) households has the potential to reduce social inequalities [@GhirardiEtAl2022;@Schmutz2024]. Early childcare facilitates women’s employment, which leads to increased family income and reduced gender inequalities [@dAlbisEtAl2017;@HermesEtAl2022;@Kimmel1998;@MartinezPerticara2022;@HumphriesEtAl2024], and it helps mitigate SES-based gaps in children’s development when the quality of care is high[@GhirardiEtAl2022;@Schmutz2024;@BergerEtAl2021;@Waldfogel2002]. However, access to early childcare remains significantly lower among low-SES households in most OECD countries, limiting its potential to mitigate inequalities[@Waldfogel2002; @OECD2019b]. Facilitating access to early childcare for those who would benefit the most is therefore of paramount importance from a policy perspective.

Low-SES households are less inclined to use early childcare for a range of reasons, including different cultural or gender norms[@CarbucciaEtAl2022a]. However, even when these households intend to access early childcare, structural factors, alongside with cognitive and behavioural factors can hinder access[@CarbucciaEtAl2022a]. Structural factors include affordability (i.e. direct and indirect costs) and accessibility (e.g. availability of early childcare slots, eligibility criteria)[@ArchambaultEtAl2019;@Lazzari2012;@PennerstorferPennerstorfer2021]. Cognitive and behavioural factors cover information access, friction costs and a range of biases13,[@CarbucciaEtAl2022a;@BettingerEtAl2012;@DynarskiEtAl2021;@HerdMoynihan2019]. Firstly, low-SES households typically have limited access to accurate information about early childcare availability, costs, eligibility criteria, and application procedures[@Bell2014;@ChaudryEtAl2010;@RadeyRandolph2009;@RothbaumEtAl2008]. Secondly, friction costs, such as the administrative burden associated with the application process, act as additional behavioural barriers[@ChristensenEtAl2020;@HerdEtAl2023;@Sunstein2019;@VandenbroeckLazzari2014]. Finally, poverty and economic insecurity may divert parental cognitive resources away from early childcare decision-making. Low-SES parents may thus rely on heuristics such as sticking to the default option of caring for the child at home[@ChaudryEtAl2010;@Kahneman2013]. Temporal discounting is stronger among low-SES populations[@HarrisonEtAl2002;@LudwigEtAl2019c;@PepperNettle2017;@YesufBluffstone2008], which can delay the application process because the immediate administrative burden is perceived as outweighing uncertain future benefits.

While structural factors have been extensively studied as determinants of unequal access  cognitive and behavioural factors have received much less attention despite recent research in psychology and behavioural economics highlighting their role in various non-take-up dynamics, such as access to higher education, healthcare, and welfare programs[@CarbucciaEtAl2022a;@HermesEtAl2021].

France is a compelling case study to examine the role of cognitive and behavioural barriers because structural barriers to early childcare enrolment are comparatively small. France offers larger access to high-quality early childcare than many OECD countries, and affordability issues are mitigated by financial aid provided by the state[@BergerEtAl2021;@OECD2016;@Collombet2018;@GomajeeEtAl2024]. For low-SES households, a full-time slot in daycare costs around €70 per month ($75 per month), which includes diapers and meals. Despite these favourable conditions, access to early childcare is highly unequal in France, with a 65 percentage points gap in attendance between the third and first income tertiles in 2014[@OECD2016]. In 2017, the government invested €3.4 billion to further increase the number of early childcare slots in France. However, this investment had a very limited impact on early childcare enrolment, particularly among low-SES households[@Pora2020; @Cnaf2018]. Cognitive and behavioural factors may hinder low-SES households from applying for early childcare even if early childcare is affordable, easily accessible, and of good quality, thus limiting the effectiveness of public policies that solely target structural factors. 

In this study, we test the impact of two scalable interventions targeting cognitive and behavioural factors to mitigate SES-based gaps in early childcare access. France has a dual system that differentiates early childcare from kindergarten. The former is accessible from as early as two months and a half after birth, which marks the end of the French maternity leave. Kindergarten is free and mandatory for children above the age of three[@Eurydice2019a]. Our study therefore focuses on access to early childcare for children under three years old. Early childcare options include childminders, and a variety of daycare centres managed by municipalities, associations, and private firms. We conducted a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in France to evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions that aimed to increase households’ application to and enrolment in early childcare. We targeted pregnant women between their 4th and 9th month of pregnancy whom we approached during their check-up visits in 8 maternity wards in the Paris region. The final sample consisted of `r round(MainDB %>% nrow(), digit = 2)` households, of which `r round(MainDB %>% filter(Educ == "Bac") %>% nrow(), digit = 2)` were from a low-SES background, as primarily defined by households in which the mother did not attend any kind of post-secondary education (more details about the sample characteristics and recruitment are provided in the Methods section). Both interventions targeted all participants, regardless of their socioeconomic status, but were specifically designed to address the barriers low-SES households face when applying for early childcare, based on prior qualitative fieldwork. To increase the external validity of our findings, we implemented the trial across 84 cities located in three districts of the Paris metropolitan area (Paris, Val-de-Marne, and Seine-Saint-Denis), each with different application processes and availability of early childcare slots, but similar early childcare costs. 

The RCT had two treatment arms and a control arm. The first treatment (‘information-only treatment’ henceforth) delivered information via five text messages, each containing a link to a short video. The videos presented the different types of early childcare services, provided detailed estimates of childcare costs as well as information on childcare centres near households’ homes, and detailed application procedures. We also provided additional tips, such as the importance of applying early and to multiple early childcare services to improve admission chances. Additionally, participants received three personalised reminders at three-month intervals. All messages and videos were presented in plain language and translated into English and Arabic. The cost of this treatment was minimal, at 5.5€ ($6) per participant. The mothers received the videos between their 4th and 9th month of pregnancy.

The second treatment (‘information + support treatment’ henceforth), aimed to alleviate the administrative burden of early childcare application. It included the same information as the first treatment, together with personalised application support through phone calls. These calls were conducted by trained interviewers two to five months after households had received the videos. This intervention was tailored to address the different stages of the decision-making process. For parents who were undecided about applying for a childcare spot, we mentioned criteria such as accessibility and affordability through cost simulations. Once parents had made their choice, we offered tailored assistance, ranging from helping them select an appropriate early childcare facility to providing support in completing application forms. The cost of this treatment was 55€ ($60) per participant, with `r MainDB %>% filter(Assignment == "T2") %>% pull(TotalMinutes_AdminSupport) %>% mean(na.rm = TRUE) %>% round(0) ` minutes spent per household on average (median:`r MainDB %>% filter(Assignment == "T2") %>% pull(TotalMinutes_AdminSupport) %>% median(na.rm = TRUE) %>% round(0)`).

We collected baseline data through face-to-face interviews conducted immediately after recruitment in the maternity wards and endline data through computer-assisted telephone interviews one year later (see Figure 1 for a detailed timeline of the study). We chose the timing of the endline to coincide with the closure of most early childcare admissions for the birth cohort included in the study. Each survey included comprehensive data on households’ demographic characteristics, early childcare preferences, intentions to use early childcare, knowledge about early childcare, past experience with early childcare facilities, and mothers’ temporal preferences. In addition, the endline survey included the pre-registered primary outcome variable on application, i.e. whether households had applied to early childcare, and the secondary outcome variable on access, i.e. whether households had accessed early childcare.

We predicted that both the information-only treatment and the information + support treatment would increase early childcare applications ($H_{1a}$ and $H_{1b}$ respectively) and access ($H_{1c}$ and $H_{1d}$) compared to an active control condition in which households received unrelated information about maternal and child health. Additionally, we predicted that the information + support treatment would have a stronger effect on applications ($H_{2a}$) and access ($H_{2b}$) than the information-only treatment. Finally, since the treatments brought particular attention to daycares, which are preferred by parents, less expensive for low-SES households than other types of childcare such as private childminders or nannies, and also more common in our catchment area, we predicted that the effect of both treatments would be stronger for daycare applications ($H_{3a}$ and $H_{3b}$ respectively) and access ($H_{3c}$ and $H_{3d}$ respectively)[@CartierEtAl2017].

Given the goals of this study, we were particularly interested in treatment heterogeneity. Following the pre-analysis plan, we explored four primary dimensions of treatment heterogeneity across households: (a) SES, (b) migration background, primarily gauged by whether the mother was born in France or not, (c) level of baseline knowledge about early childcare, and (d) prior use of early childcare. We predicted that both treatments would have a greater impact on: (a) low-SES households, (b) households with a migration background, (c) households with limited baseline knowledge, and (d) households that had never used early childcare before. Given that the treatments enhanced the salience of early childcare application and mitigated friction costs, we also pre-registered heterogeneous effects based on mother’s temporal orientation, measured through an intertemporal choice task, as exploratory analyses.
