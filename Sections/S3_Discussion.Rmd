This study addressed socioeconomic disparities in access to early childcare through two scalable interventions. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an information treatment provided via videos and text messages and a second intervention offering personalised application support via phone calls. This experimental design allowed us to assess the effects of a low-cost information intervention and a more expensive but scalable support intervention.

The results revealed a sizeable intention-to-action gap among low-SES and immigrant households when comparing their intentions to use early childcare during pregnancy with their actual application rates. The information-only treatment failed to bridge this intention-to-action gap, but the information + support treatment significantly reduced it. The intervention closed the application gaps for compliers based on householdsâ€™ SES and migration background. 

These results provide insights into the factors contributing to social gradients in early childcare application and access. First, in line with recent evidence, the high intention rates, even among low-SES and immigrant households, indicate that cultural factors, such as traditional gender norms, exert a limited impact on the observed gaps (see also Supplementary Tables 4.3.4)16,54. Instead, cognitive and behavioural barriers are more important determinants. Indeed, combining information with personalised support to reduce information, process and psychological costs significantly bridged the intention-to-action gaps in application. These findings highlight the potential of light-touch, highly scalable, cost-effective behavioural interventions in alleviating these costs.

Addressing cognitive and behavioural barriers was necessary to bridge the intention-application gaps observed in the control group. However, it was insufficient to tackle socioeconomic disparities in early childcare access. Despite a substantial increase in application rates, neither intervention impacted access, except for specific subgroups having a very low probability of accessing early childcare without support, such as households facing very high information costs and households with low trust in early childcare at baseline. This limited impact suggests that structural barriers also play a significant role. First, the allocation process of slots itself may perpetuate inequalities: while the information + support intervention increased application rates across SES groups, only high-SES dual-earner households accessed daycare more. This suggests that, despite national guidelines stating otherwise, allocation criteria still prioritize dual-earner families with stable working hours48. Second, households with higher social, economic, and cultural capital may be better positioned in a complex system to secure the limited available slots through various mechanisms (Supplementary Information 4.4). While the support intervention did not increase overall access to early childcare for high-SES households, it did help them to secure their preferred type of care, namely daycare centres, over alternative care options. Finally, while not directly measured in our study, discrimination remains a plausible explanation for persistent disparities in access, particularly for immigrant households, as documented in other countries55.


Our findings contrast with those of Hermes et al. (2021), who also conducted an RCT on access to early childcare[@HermesEtAl2021]. In this study, information and support provision impacted both application and access rates for low-SES households in Germany. Two key design differences may explain these discrepant findings. First, their intervention occurred after children's birth, with longer in-person support sessions (median: 2 hours vs. 6 minutes in our study; mean: 1.5 hours vs. 15 minutes). Second, our study aimed to enhance scalability by delivering all interventions remotely. This approach likely resulted in lower parental engagement compared to the in-person support used by Hermes et al., who could ensure that all households watched the information videos. 

Our study makes several significant contributions to the existing literature. It contributes to the literature on the determinants of early childcare access gaps by identifying precise mechanisms and differentiating between the causal effects of information provision and personalised support in mitigating these disparities. Additionally, it contributes to the literature on administrative burden and non-take-up of social programmes, revealing the importance of behavioural barriers for early childcare access[@HerdEtAl2023;@Sunstein2019]. Finally, it offers valuable insights into the intergenerational transmission of inequalities by examining mechanisms operating during early childhood[@GarciaEtAl2023]..



Our findings provide critical insights for policymakers. While disseminating information through videos and text messages is a cheap strategy, we provide strong evidence that this strategy is insufficient to close the gaps.  This aligns with previous research demonstrating the limited impact of information provision in isolation in various areas, such as tax credits[@LinosEtAl2022], indoor pollution[@AbdelSaterEtAl2021], and college enrolment[@BettingerEtAl2012].Additional barriers prevent households from acting on their intentions even when informed. In parallel, we developed and tested an easily scalable intervention that effectively closed social gradients in application behaviour. Moreover, we showed that increased application rates did not translate into higher access rates for most subgroups, which indicates the persistence of structural barriers in the French context. If policymakers want to equalise access to early childcare, they need to address cognitive and behavioural barriers as well as structural barriers. For example, without universal coverage, prioritising dual earners and the order of application in slot allocation may perpetuate inequalities59. To ensure equitable access, designing applications and slot allocation systems that consider the challenges low-SES households face in their decision-making and application process is crucial.

This study has several limitations. First, our RCT mainly focuses on urban areas. Further research is needed to understand the dynamics in rural regions where certain types of early childcare, such as childminders, are more common. Additionally, the support provided to households in our study was presented as part of a research project rather than being offered by well-known institutions like government services. If recognised institutional figures delivered similar interventions, the results might differ. Moreover, while the one-year observation window aligns with the timing of early childcare allocations in France, it remains possible that additional positive enrolment effects materialise later, particularly for households placed on waiting lists. Finally, further research must address structural barriers that persist after households submit their applications. Investigating priority rules, territorial disparities in early childcare availability, disparities in households' application behaviour, and the long-term effects of early childcare access on child development can provide deeper insights into effective policy design.
