This study aimed to address socioeconomic disparities in access to early childcare through two scalable interventions. We conducted a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an information treatment provided *via* videos and text messages, and of a second intervention that included personalised application support *via* telephone calls in addition to information provision. This experimental design allowed us to assess the effects of a low-cost information intervention and of a more expensive but still scalable support intervention, which increased costs from $6 to $60 per household. 

The results reveal large intention-to-action gaps among low-SES households and households with a migration background when comparing their intention to use early childcare services during pregnancy and their actual application rates. The information-only treatment failed to bridge this intention-to-action gap. However, the information + support treatment significantly increased application rates among low-SES households and households with a migration background. For compliers, the intervention entirely closed the application gaps by households SES and migration background. The same conclusions hold for households with limited baseline knowledge of early childcare and present-orientated households.

These results provide insight into the factors that contribute to social gradients in early childcare application and access. First, our results indicate that cultural factors, such as traditional gender norms, have a minimal impact on socioeconomic gaps in early childcare access within the context of our study[@VanLanckerPavolini2023] . Most low-SES households and households with a migration background in our sample expressed a preference for using early childcare facilities but faced several hurdles in doing so. Secondly, while the information-only treatment was ineffective in bridging the intention-to-action gap, adding personalised administrative support significantly boosted application rates. This suggests that the primary mechanism at play is not a lack of information but rather the administrative burden that underprivileged groups face when navigating the application process. These findings highlight the potential of light-touch, highly scalable, cost-effective behavioural interventions in alleviating administrative burdens. Finally, the increase in applications was primarily driven by households in which the mother was inactive at the start of the study. In France, childcare access has historically prioritised children of dual-earner couples. This suggests that the intervention empowered inactive mothers who felt more confident in applying, even if they did not view themselves as the primary beneficiaries of early childcare services[@CREDOC2023].

However, while addressing administrative burdens is necessary to bridge the intention-application gaps, it is not sufficient to tackle socioeconomic disparities in early childcare access. Despite a substantial increase in application rates, neither intervention impacted access for most subgroups, except for households with limited baseline knowledge of early childcare. This suggests that structural barriers also play a significant role. In particular, while the information + support intervention increased the probability that both low- and high-SES households apply for daycare, only high-SES dual-earner households experienced increased access to these facilities. Although national guidelines state that dual-earner households should no longer be prioritised, these results suggest that the allocation criteria used to assign the available slots further exacerbate inequalities by still prioritising such factors48. While the support intervention did not enhance overall access to early childcare for high-SES households, it did help them to secure their preferred type of care, namely daycare centres, over alternative care options. 

Our findings contrast with those of Hermes et al. (2021), who conducted the only previous RCT on access to childcare and observed large impacts on both application and access rates for low-SES households in Germany. There are two potential explanations for these discrepant findings[@HermesEtAl2021]. On the one hand, there are important structural differences between France and Germany. In France, in addition to the priority given to dual-earner households, territorial disparities in early childcare availability may have diluted the impact of our interventions on early childcare access. Indeed, to enhance external validity, we included areas with low early childcare coverage, where our demand-side interventions may have had limited effects on access (see Methods section and Supplementary Information Section 1). On the other hand, the designs of the two studies are different. Our study aimed to enhance scalability by delivering all interventions remotely. This approach likely resulted in lower parental engagement compared to the in-person support used by Hermes et al. which for instance ensured that all households watched the information videos[@HermesEtAl2021]. 

Our study makes several significant contributions to the existing literature. It is the first to differentiate between the causal effects of information provision and of personalised support in mitigating SES-based disparities in access to early childcare. Additionally, it contributes to the literature on administrative burden and non-take-up of social programmes, revealing the importance of behavioural barriers also for early childcare access[@HerdEtAl2023;@Sunstein2019]. Moreover, it offers valuable insights into the intergenerational transmission of inequalities by examining mechanisms operating during early childhood[@GarciaEtAl2023].

Our findings provide critical insights for policymakers. While the dissemination of information through videos and text messages is a cheap strategy, we provide strong evidence that this strategy is insufficient to bridge the gaps in applications to childcare. This aligns with previous research demonstrating the limited impact of information provision in various areas, such as tax credits[@LinosEtAl2022], indoor pollution[@AbdelSaterEtAl2021], and college enrolment[@BettingerEtAl2012]. Additional barriers, such as the administrative burden of applying for early childcare, prevent households from acting on their intentions even when informed. In parallel, we developed and tested an easily scalable intervention that proved effective in closing social gradients in application behaviour. Moreover, we showed that increased application rates did not translate into higher access rates for most subgroups, which indicates the persistence of structural barriers in the French context. If policymakers want to equalize access to early childcare they need to address cognitive and behavioural barriers as well as structural barriers. For example, in the absence of universal coverage, prioritising dual-earners and the order of application in slot allocation may perpetuate inequalities48. To ensure equitable access, it is crucial to design applications and slot allocation systems that consider the challenges faced by low-SES households in their decision-making and application process.

It is important to note some limitations of our study. First, our RCT mainly focuses on urban areas. Further research is needed to understand the dynamics in rural regions where certain types of early childcare, such as childminders, are more common. Additionally, the support provided to households in our study was presented as part of a research project, rather than being offered by well-known institutions like government services. If similar interventions were delivered by recognised institutional figures, the results might differ. Finally, further research is necessary to identify and address the structural barriers that persist after households submit their applications. Investigating allocation criteria, territorial disparities in early childcare availability, and the long-term effects of early childcare access on child development can provide deeper insights into effective policy measures.
